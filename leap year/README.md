# leap-year
checks to see if a number inputed is a leap year.
honestly this project might be pretty rushed. it checks to see if a year was a leap year or not. feel free to tell me if there's a mistake in the code, because honestly these sort of codecademy projects are so easy, at this point it's not even enjoyable
